- 29/Dec/2025 [Monday]--->
  Completed all questions from the *Extra Built-in Functions assignment*, including newly introduced time-based problems. Learned and implemented these concepts hands-on by writing and testing code, which improved practical understanding and problem-solving accuracy.
  Practiced and solved 4 scenario-based problems, focusing on applying core Java concepts to real-world situations.
  Completed one complex, large-scale scenario, which required structured logic, step-by-step problem breakdown, and clean implementation.

- 30/Dec/2025 [Tuesday]--->
  Implemented and solved a Line Comparison problem using a scenario-based approach, applying  conditional logic and object-oriented concepts to compare multiple line segments accurately.
  Designed and implemented a Snake and Ladder game as a scenario-based problem, focusing on game flow   control, random number generation, and rule-based state transitions.


- 31/Dec/2025 [Wednesday]--->
  Implemented constructor-based problems to understand object initialization and lifecycle
  (Solved in oops-practice branch)
  Practiced problems based on instance variables, class (static) variables, and methods, ensuring clear differentiation between object-level and class-level behavior
  Solved keyword-based questions, including practical usage of: , this , static , final , instanceof





- 1/Jan/2026 [Wednesday]--->


- 2/Jan/2026 [Friday]--->
  Designed and submitted an assignment based on *Object Oriented Design* Principles, focusing on   creating a clean, modular, and maintainable object-oriented structure. The design emphasizes proper responsibility distribution and low coupling between components.

- 3/Jan/2026 [Friday]--->
  Complete assignment of *Inheritance* and Studied the concept of  inheritance in Java in depth and strengthened the fundamentals of object-oriented design. Practiced and solved problems covering all major types of inheritance, including single, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.
